          React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and
          interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an
          open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for
          the applicationâ€™s view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC)
          architecture, the view layer is responsible for how the app looks and
          feels. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at
          Facebook.
